        <h2>Chapter 1: About Me</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            I grew up in a pretty small town. Our community was very tight knit. 
            My childhood was filled lots of outdoor adventure playing in the woods, sports, and school events. 
            During early childhood I got involved with technical theatre. Technical theatre showed me how tech is everywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
            My family has always been supportive of my interests, encouraging me to explore new skills and hobbies. 
            I spent countless hours experimenting technical theatre products. Trying to build and create the next big thing. 
            One of my favorite memories is taking apart an old moving stage light just to see <span class="sentence">how all of the components fit together.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of academics, I enjoy a variety of hobbies including cooking, bike riding, and watching movies. 
            I find that spending time bike riding helps me reset and stay focused during busy weeks. 
            Cooking has become a creative outlet for me, allowing experimentation with flavors and techniques.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, I continue to pursue my passion for learning, especially in areas related to web development and software. 
            Enrolling at Bellevue University has provided me with opportunities to grow these skills. 
            I look forward to applying what I learn to future projects and career goals.
