    <p>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript – Part 1</p>

    <p>
        I woke up before the sun came up. Coffee was already brewing because I set it the night before.
        I had a full day planned and I wasn't going to waste a single minute of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        By 6am my bike was loaded and I was heading up the mountain. The trail was still
        <span id="damp">__________</span>
        from the night before and the dirt was perfect. I hit the first drop and let the bike do its thing.
        My tires gripped, my body stayed loose, and I just flowed through it. Section after section I pushed harder.
        My lungs were <span id="burning">__________</span> but I didn't care. This is what I live for.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a few hours I rolled back to camp. Most people would sit down and rest. I grabbed my tools instead.
        I had been working on a wood rack for the camp kitchen and I wanted to finish it before dark.
        I measured twice, cut once, and started putting it together. There is something
        <span id="satisfying">__________</span>
        about building something with your hands. When it was done it was
        <span id="solid">__________</span>.
        It wasn't fancy but it worked and I made it myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        I got the fire going as the sun dropped behind the ridge. I sat back and looked around at the trees,
        the smoke curling up, and the rack I just built sitting there next to the cooler.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a good day. It always is when I get to ride hard and build something.
    </p>
